FRED is a framework to support the design, development, and execution of *predictable* software on **FPGA** system-on-chips platforms.

It exploits **dynamic partial reconfiguration** and recurrent execution to virtualize the FPGA fabric, enabling the user to allocate a larger number of hardware accelerators than could otherwise be fit into the physical fabric. It integrates *automated floorplanning* and a set of *runtime mechanisms* to enhance predictability by scheduling hardware resources and regulating bus/memory contention.

The project is in developed at the `Real-Time Systems Laboratory (RETIS Lab) <https://retis.santannapisa.it/>`_ of the `Scuola Superiore Santâ€™Anna <https://www.santannapisa.it/en>`_ of Pisa.
