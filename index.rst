FRED is a framework to support the design, development, and execution of *predictable* software on FPGA system-on-chips platforms.

It exploits **dynamic partial reconfiguration** and recurrent execution to virtualize the FPGA fabric, enabling the user to allocate a larger number of hardware accelerators than could otherwise be fit into the physical fabric. It integrates *automated floorplanning* and a set of *runtime mechanisms* to enhance predictability by scheduling hardware resources and regulating bus/memory contention.

    FRED workflow

The :ref:`fred_framework_fig` figure shows the 5 pillars of FRED framework: floorplanner, bus synthesis, bus manager, runtime, and the analyzer. As presented next, the current focus is on the automatic floorplanner and FRED runtime. The other items are to be included into the framework in the future.


The project is in developed at the `Real-Time Systems Laboratory (RETIS Lab) <https://retis.santannapisa.it/>`_ of the `Scuola Superiore Santâ€™Anna <https://www.santannapisa.it/en>`_ of Pisa.

Table of Contents
------------------

This document is organized as folloes. First it presents and introduction of the framework. The five next sections describes the five parts presented in the :ref:`fred_framework_fig` figure. Next there is the gettig started section which guides through the framework instalation and setup. The next section presents some case studies, research roadmap, complete list of publications, and additional project-related information.
