Reseach Roadmap
================

These are the main areas of research/development for the near future:

- Currently DART optimizes FPGA resource usage and timing. In the future it will also optimize power;

- The regulating bus/memory contention (aka the `predictable bus manager <../bus-manager>`_) mechanisms are still not fully integrated to the framework;

- Integrate the FRED framework with APP4MC/Amalthea to enable Model Based Engineering with FPGA offloading;

- Integrate the FRED framework with Xilinx Vitis AI flow for accelerating deep learning applications;

- Integrate the FRED framework with ROS2 for robotics and automonous vehicle applications;
